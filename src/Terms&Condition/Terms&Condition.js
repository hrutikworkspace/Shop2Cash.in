              <h6> 3. Our Service:</h6>
              <p className="p3">
                Cashback Service: Our Cashback Service allows users who register
                on the Platform ("Members") and therefore create an account with
                us ("Account") to earn cashback by making purchases from the
                retailers listed on Our Platform ("Retailers"). To qualify for
                cashback, the Retailer must confirm that the Member's purchase
                is tracked, genuine and successful (constituting a "Qualifying
                Transaction"), and your resulting cashback must be received by
                us (becoming “Cashback” as a result). The earned Cashback can be
                transferred directly to the bank accounts only after reaching
                the minimum limit of threshold set by Us. A transaction is
                termed to be a qualified transaction where, the user is
                redirected by CashKaro to the Retailer’s platform /Website
                making a valid and subsisting purchase afterwhich the
                Product/service is duly delivered, and the refund/return period
                has also expired. In the event that the Retailers do not track a
                transaction using their affiliate tracking system, then such
                sales might not be paid to CashKaro, and hence any due or
                expected cashback from these sales will also not be paid to the
                Member. Reward Program Our Reward program allows the registered
                users to earn Rewards by making purchases through Us and
                thereafter be redirected to the selective retailers, with whom,
                we have partnered and agreed to provide rewards instead of
                cashbacks. Earnings in the form of rewards cannot be transferred
                to the bank account of the user but can only be redeemed via
                gift cards or wallet, only after reaching the minimum limit of
                threshold set by Us. Unique Referral Fee: The CashKaro Service
                also provides a unique referral fee to its Members where the
                Existing Members (referrer) gets 10% (Ten percent) cashback on
                each new Member's (referee) introduced by them in the manner
                provided on the Platform ("Qualifying Referral") as long as they
                remain a Member themselves. The referee, transacting at specific
                stores/retailers, may not make the referrer qualify for the 10%
                cashbacks. Please see Clause 5 below for details CashKaro
                complies to stringent laws of the land and the Members are
                obliged to stick to the lawful use of our website. We are
                persistent to enhance our referral programme and we retain the
                right to modify any referral programme terms at any time and
                without notice.

              <h6>5. Cashback/Reward and Referral Fees:</h6>
              <p className="p5">
                After a Member successfully completes a Qualifying Transaction,
                and once we have received the resulting Cashback/Reward for that
                Qualifying Transaction, we pass that Cashback/Reward to the
                Member through his/her Cashback Receipt Method. Please note that
                there are various circumstances in which a transaction with a
                Retailer may not constitute a Qualifying Transaction, or
                Cashback/Rewards may not result from it. This is also true for a
                Qualifying Referral. The Member understands that all
                transactions made by him/her are not with us, but with the
                individual Retailer. Our help pages provide further information
                about these circumstances. Further, from time to time Retailers
                may increase or decrease the commission paid – in which case the
                cashback/Reward offer illustrated on our Platform may be
                incorrect/outdated. By default, your applicable transactions
                will be credited in line with the commission reported to us by
                the Retailer, which may be more or less than the advertised
                rate. We shall not be liable for any difference in the expected
                cashback/reward by the Member and the actual Cashback/reward
                received by the Member. When we have traced a paying, Qualifying
                Transaction to your Account, we will credit your Account with a
                'pending payment'. Once the Retailer confirms the transaction,
                the payment will be marked as 'validated' – this can take 90
                days or more from the date of the purchase. If the goods are
                returned or the sale reversed or amended by any means, then the
                cashback/reward payment will not be made. Apart from the
                Retailer, it is also mandatory for the members to intimate
                CashKaro about any returns or exchanges for which they might
                have earned cashback/reward unduly. Whether a transaction shall
                qualify as a Qualifying Transaction (including cashback through
                a Qualifying Referral) shall be at the sole discretion of the
                Retailer or Us and the Member understands and agrees to the
                same. We shall not be held responsible if the Retailer fails to
                report a sale to us or does not qualify a transaction as
                Qualifying Transaction. Further, we shall not be responsible in
                the event due to some technical or other errors we cannot trace
                a sale back to the Member and does not qualify the transaction
                as a Qualifying Transaction or a Qualifying Referral for any
                reason whatsoever. Whilst we will endeavour to recuperate
                non-payments from the Retailer, the decision of ourselves, the
                Retailer or Retailer's tracking agent shall stand final. Whilst
                we will try and recuperate missing commissions, at any point as
                well as, we reserve the right not to chase missing commission
                claims, particularly where no purchase has been made. Further,
                in the event that the Retailer feels that the purchase is not
                genuine for any reason whatsoever and we do not receive any
                Cashback/Rewards for the transaction, the Member will not
                receive any Cashback/Rewards. When a Member sends us an enquiry
                on missing cashback/reward via raising a ticket, our system
                would check if the user had an exit click from our Platform for
                that store on the date mentioned by the user. If no exit clicks
                can be tracked, then the Member will be indicated that they did
                not click via our website to earn cashback/reward prior to the
                sale. All exit clicks to stores are saved in the database for
                cross reference on adding cashback/reward values. Where a
                commission enquiry has been successfully paid by a Retailer, you
                may receive a lower amount than expected; this is due to the
                amounts received by ourselves possibly being lower than the
                original claim. We do allow you to raise a query with us. If a
                Retailer still hasn't paid a manual commission claim after a
                period of six months, then we reserve the right to close the
                enquiry claim. All payment for Missing Cashback/Reward is only
                applicable in instances where the Retailer pays CashKaro. Note:
                The User raising or intending to raise a ticket in case of an
                enquiry of missing cashback/ reward shall raise the same within
                10 (Ten) days from the date of the transaction. No claim shall
                be entertained by any registered User post the stipulated
                time-line. We reserve the right to reclaim or make balance
                adjustments accordingly where it has been established that any
                credit has been applied in error. This will include but is not
                limited to transactions where the credit is not genuinely due or
                payment for any credited transaction has not been received from
                a Retailer or its agencies and/or misuse or fraud. This can
                include transactions which are already marked as payable or
                validated in your Account, or for transactions which have
                already been paid over to you by Bank Transfer, Gift
                Cards/wallets, UPIs or any other payment modes as We may
                introduce from time to time. In all such incidences, CashKaro
                has the right to recover all unduly paid cashback/rewards which
                the member is not entitled to earn, through legal proceedings.
                The User while raising a pay-out request, shall ensure choosing
                the withdrawal method (Bank Transfer, Gift Card/wallet, UPIs,
                etc.) containing the correct credentials and if the customer
                provides incorrect details and we process the pay-out(s), we
                shall not bear any liability against the same. Such, negligence
                shall be seen as the User’s error.

                not be payable to the Member, and will be forfeited by us, these
